Building
--------------
The accompanying projects and solution files are currently Visual Studio 2017 format.

Note that this tool only makes sense on Windows platforms.

Debugging and Testing
--------------

You can easily create a process tree and the situation that this tool solves using the command prompt, start one prompt and enter:

  start /wait cmd /c pause

This will start a child process command prompt and wait for its termination.That however with "pause" waits for a user key input. When you kill the parent process, the prompt executing the above command is still there (the child process will then be parent-less).
